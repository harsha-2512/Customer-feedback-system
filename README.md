A customer feedback system — which these days usually takes the form of a software product or application — helps businesses manage what customers are saying on multiple feedback platforms and channels, as well as gain data-driven insights essential to improving overall customer experience.
Customer feedback software and systems also help organizations, from the C-suite to frontline employees, understand their customers better and therefore more easily measure (and improve) customer satisfaction and loyalty.
